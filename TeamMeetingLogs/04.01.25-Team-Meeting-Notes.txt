A big takeaway from this meeting is that we will no longer be dividing work between frontend and backend because of issues we ran into with overlapping work
and having to wait for others to complete their tasks before we could get started on our own. Going forward, work will be divided based on feature.

What we did this week:
    Julia: added the pop up side bar that will serve as the events filter in the future, added the base code to the setup file so everyone could start working
    Mia: created the database and set up the individual events page
    Jessie: set up login/logout pages with routes, Readme file
    Makaela: added a search bar to the nav bar and added the interactive CU Boulder map to the home page
    Jules:

What we will work on next week:
    Julia: add filters to the pop up side bar and display each event in the side bar
    Mia: add authorizations to index.js 
    Jessie: add register new user forms and user profile page (with edit user profile option)
    Makaela: add pins to the map for each event, add search results page
    Jules: add commenting to the bottom of the events page
